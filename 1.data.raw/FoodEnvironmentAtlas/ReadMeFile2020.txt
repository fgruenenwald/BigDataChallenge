The objectives of the Atlas are to assemble statistics on food 
environment indicators to stimulate research on the determinants of food 
choices and diet quality, and to provide a spatial overview of a 
community's ability to access healthy food.The Atlas currently includes 
over 280 indicators of the food environment.The year and geographic 
level of the indicators vary to better accommodate data from a variety of 
sources. Some indicators are at the county level while others are at the 
State or regional level.The most recent county-level data are used 
whenever possible.
